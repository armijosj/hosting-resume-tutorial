## FAQ

#### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

Because Markdown provides a great website export. In this way documents can be updated regularly and be kept in a version control.

#### Why is my resume not updating?

It usually takes a few minutes for updates to go through the static site. If after some time the site is still not updating then check for errors on the new contribution.
